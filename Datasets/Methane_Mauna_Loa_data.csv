# Uncertainties in the global monthly means are estimated using two,,,,,,
# terms: The first is a bootstrap (resampling) method that varies the,,,,,,
# sites in our network. Each pseudo-network contains the same number of,,,,,,
# sites as our actual NOAA ESRL cooperative global air sampling network,,,,,,
# but some are repeated and some are excluded. The second term is a,,,,,,
# Monte Carlo method that randomly modifies the data to account for,,,,,,
# measurement uncertainty. In both cases, 100 globally-averaged time,,,,,
# series are created. Standard deviations of the monthly means are,,,,,,
# calculated, and the two terms (network and analytical) are taken in,,,,,
# quadrature to give the  reported uncertainties. A default value (-9.9),,,,,,
# indicates the uncertainty has not yet been calculated for that month.,,,,,,
