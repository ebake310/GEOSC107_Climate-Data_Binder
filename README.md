# GEOSC107 Lab 11: Analyzing Climate Datasets
Data and code for GEOSC 107 laboratory exercise. Students learn to make simple plots in Python. This is an introductory activity for college students to learn some simple Python tools.

The Analysis Notebook contains a Jupyter Notebook that has been started for the laboratory activity. It contains one example of how to upload data from a csv file using pandas and then plot the data using Matplotlib. An environment with the necessary packages has been provided. This exercise can be run through Binder at to https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ebake310/GEOSC107_Climate-Data_Binder/HEAD so that students do not need Python on their laptops. Binder can be slow to load the first time it is opened as it prepares the environment.

The Dataset folder contains all of the datasets used in this laboratory exercise. All datasets are saved as csv files so that students only need to learn one method for importing files using pandas.
